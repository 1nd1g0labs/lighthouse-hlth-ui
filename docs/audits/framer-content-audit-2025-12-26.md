# Framer Website Content Audit
**Lighthouse HLTH Marketing Alignment Assessment**

**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Audited by:** AI Marketing Strategist
**Website:** lighthousehlth.com
**Strategic Source:** lighthouse-hlth-northstar-strategy/gtm/

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Alignment Score: 2.5/5 (Major Gaps Identified)**

The current Framer website for Lighthouse HLTH represents a **generic healthcare template** that does not reflect our strategic positioning as a **healthcare operational sustainability platform**. The site uses placeholder medical/clinical messaging (patient care, doctors, diagnostics) instead of our actual value proposition: turning sustainability compliance into margin expansion for hospital systems.

### Critical Finding
**The website is selling the wrong product.** Current content suggests a patient-facing medical practice, while our actual ICP is B2B healthcare executives (CFOs, COOs, Sustainability Officers) seeking operational sustainability solutions.

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Complete content overhaul** - Remove all patient-care language, replace with B2B operational sustainability messaging
2. **Value proposition realignment** - Lead with "15-20% margin improvement" and "HB21-1286 compliance," not "patient health"
3. **Stakeholder-specific messaging** - Separate landing sections for CFO, Mission Leader, COO, Facilities Director personas
4. **Colorado market focus** - Add Colorado-specific regulatory hooks and case examples

### About Us Page (/about-us)

#### Current Content (Extracted from Framer XML)

**Hero:**
- Headline: "Building a healthier future through sustainable care"
- Subheadline: "Our mission is simple — make sustainability make sense for US hospitals: financially, clinically, and operationally."
- CTA: "Contact us"

**Who We Are Section:**
- Headline: "Grow with expert sustainability built on care & clarity"
- Body: "What we've learned: Hospitals thrive when sustainability data is auditable and CFO-ready. The path to decarbonization is the same as the path to operational efficiency. Climate action accelerates patient care quality and equity. Lighthouse Health is the next evolution — built independently, designed specifically for HIPAA and U.S. regulatory standards."

**Mission/Vision/Goals:**
- Mission: "We strive to deliver reliable, personalized, and compassionate healthcare that improves quality of life & supports"
- Vision: "To lead the future of healthcare through continuous innovation, expert-led care, & a deep commitment to patient trust"
- Future Goal: "We aim to expand access to specialized care, introduce smarter health solutions, and shape a experts future"

**Stats (Generic):**
- "10K+ Patients activated for climate"
- "97%+ Positive recovery"
- "330+ Certified professionals"
- "24/7 Active support"

**Why Choose Us Features:**
- "Modern instruments"
- "Trusted diagnostics"
- "Expert support"

**Alignment Score: 2/5 (Significant Issues)**

#### What's Right ✅
1. **Hero subheadline is good:** "make sustainability make sense for US hospitals: financially, clinically, and operationally" - **This aligns with our positioning!**
2. **CFO-ready language:** "sustainability data is auditable and CFO-ready" - **Excellent stakeholder targeting**
3. **Operational efficiency connection:** "The path to decarbonization is the same as the path to operational efficiency" - **Core message from Sales Playbook**
4. **HIPAA compliance mention:** Shows regulatory awareness

#### What's Wrong ❌

1. **Mission/Vision/Goals are GENERIC HEALTHCARE TEMPLATE:**
   - "personalized, and compassionate healthcare" = Patient-care language
   - "expert-led care" = Clinical services, not B2B SaaS
   - "expand access to specialized care" = Wrong product entirely
   - **This reads like a hospital's about page, not a B2B sustainability platform**

2. **Stats are nonsensical for our business:**
   - "Patients activated for climate"? We don't serve patients, we serve hospital systems
   - "Positive recovery"? We're not a clinical provider
   - "Certified professionals"? Should be "Hospital customers" or "Facilities under management"

3. **Why Choose Us features are clinical:**
   - "Modern instruments" = Medical equipment (wrong)
   - "Trusted diagnostics" = Lab services (wrong)
   - Should be "Automated Compliance," "Healthcare-Native Platform," "Proven ROI"

4. **Missing key differentiators:**
   - No mention of European track record ("50+ hospitals")
   - No "vs. shadow.eco" or "vs. consultants" positioning
   - No Colorado market focus
   - No specific $ savings examples

#### Recommended About Page Messaging

**Hero:**
- Headline: "Operational Sustainability as Moral Imperative & Margin Expansion"
- Subheadline: "Lighthouse HLTH was built by healthcare sustainability veterans who saw hospital systems spending $50-100K on consultants for compliance reports—while operational waste went unidentified. We're making sustainability achievable for every health system, regardless of size or resources."
- CTA: "See Our Approach" (scroll to framework) + "Schedule Discovery Call"

**Who We Are:**
- Headline: "Healthcare-Native Sustainability, Built for US Compliance"
- Body:
  - "Founded by the team behind successful European healthcare sustainability deployments, we've adapted our proven methodology for US hospitals navigating the convergence of regulatory compliance (HB21-1286, SEC climate disclosure), financial pressure, and mission commitments.
  - What we've learned: Hospitals thrive when sustainability data is auditable and CFO-ready. The path to decarbonization is the same as the path to operational efficiency. Climate action accelerates margin improvement.
  - Lighthouse HLTH is purpose-built for HIPAA compliance, US regulatory standards, and healthcare-specific operational metrics (patient-days normalization, OR utilization, clinical waste)."

**Our Differentiators (Replace Mission/Vision/Goals):**

**1. Healthcare-Native Platform**
"We don't build generic carbon tools. We build operational intelligence platforms that happen to reduce your carbon footprint. Features like HVAC optimization, OR supply waste tracking, and patient-days normalization are built-in—not bolted on."

**2. Proven European Success, US-Ready**
"Deployed at 50+ European hospitals with validated 15-20% margin improvement. Adapted for US compliance (HB21-1286, Practice Greenhealth, GHG Protocol) and HIPAA architecture."

**3. Self-Service + White-Glove**
"Replace $50-100K annual consulting spend with a platform that delivers continuous intelligence. Implementation in 30 days, ROI demonstration in 90 days, full payback in 12-18 months."

**Stats (Replace with Real Metrics):**
- "$67K Average CAH Savings" (from Sales Playbook)
- "18-Month ROI Payback" (from Pricing Model)
- "50+ Hospitals Deployed" (European track record)
- "One-Click Compliance" (HB21-1286 Portfolio Manager export)

**Why Choose Us (Replace Features):**
- "**Automated Compliance:** One-click ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager export for HB21-1286"
- "**Healthcare-Specific:** OR waste, clinical supply optimization, patient-days normalization"
- "**Proven ROI:** 15-20% margin improvement, 192% 3-year return"

2. "View our services" (link button)

**Services Page:**
1. "Get in touch" (hero)
2. "View doctors" (hero - completely wrong)

**CTA Alignment Score: 0/5**

### What's Wrong with Current CTAs

❌ **Too Generic:**

**Homepage:**

### Recommended Differentiation Strategy

**Homepage Comparison Section:**

**Headline:** "The Smarter Alternative to Traditional Consulting"

**Comparison Table:**

| Capability | Lighthouse HLTH | Consultants | Generic Platforms | DIY Excel |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Annual Cost** | $25-150K | $50-100K/engagement | $40-80K | $36K+ (staff time) |
| **HB21-1286 Compliance** | ✅ Automated | ⚠️ One-time report | ❌ Not healthcare | ❌ Manual |
| **Healthcare Features** | ✅ OR waste, patient-days | ❌ Generic | ❌ Generic | ❌ None |

| **3-Year ROI** | 192% | Minimal | Unknown | Negative |

**Key Differentiators to Highlight:**

**1. vs. Shadow.eco / Generic Platforms:**
"We don't build generic carbon tools. Lighthouse HLTH is healthcare-native: HIPAA-compliant, OR supply optimization, patient-days normalization, clinical waste tracking. Features shadow.eco will never have."

**2. vs. Consultancies:**
"Why pay $100K for an annual PDF when our platform provides continuous intelligence for less? Self-service + white-glove onboarding replaces consultant dependency."

**3. vs. Point Solutions:**
"One platform, three standards: HB21-1286 + Practice Greenhealth + GHG Protocol. Not fragmented tools requiring manual reconciliation."

**4. vs. Status Quo / DIY:**
"Your sustainability team's 100+ hours of spreadsheet work costs $50K+ in hidden labor—plus 20%+ error rates. Automate compliance, identify savings, eliminate penalties."

[Icon: Clipboard checklist]
Colorado HB21-1286 mandates 7% GHG reduction by 2026. Practice Greenhealth reporting. SEC climate disclosure. Penalties starting at $50K+ for non-compliance.

**2. Consultant Costs**
[Icon: Dollar drain]
Traditional energy consultants charge $50-100K for one-time assessments. No ongoing visibility. No platform. Dependency on expensive re-engagements.

**3. Hidden Waste**
[Icon: Leak/waste]
Most hospitals waste 15-20% on energy and operational inefficiency—but lack the tools to identify and capture savings. Spreadsheets don't scale.

- **Recommended:** "Operational Sustainability as Moral Imperative & Margin Expansion"

**Keep subheadline (IT'S GOOD!):**

  - "Founded by the team behind successful European healthcare sustainability deployments (50+ hospitals), we saw US hospital systems spending $50-100K on consultants for compliance reports while operational waste went unidentified.
  - What we've learned: Hospitals thrive when sustainability data is auditable and CFO-ready. The path to decarbonization is the same as the path to operational efficiency. Climate action accelerates margin improvement—not just environmental goals.
  - Lighthouse HLTH is purpose-built for HIPAA compliance, US regulatory standards (HB21-1286, Practice Greenhealth, GHG Protocol), and healthcare-specific operational metrics (patient-days normalization, OR utilization, clinical waste)."

**Card 2: Proven Success, US-Ready**
"Deployed at 50+ European hospitals with validated 15-20% margin improvement. Adapted for US compliance (HB21-1286, Practice Greenhealth, GHG Protocol) and HIPAA architecture."

**Card 3: Self-Service + White-Glove**

## Appendix A: Key Messaging Library

### Value Proposition One-Liners (By Persona)

**CFO:**
"Turn Colorado HB21-1286 compliance into 15-20% margin improvement—$67K average savings for a 150-bed CAH with 18-month ROI payback."

**Facilities Director:**
"Automate your ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager reporting and reclaim 10 hours per month—2 days quarterly reduced to 5 minutes monthly."

**Sustainability Officer:**
"Unified compliance across HB21-1286, Practice Greenhealth, and GHG Protocol—one platform replaces three separate programs."

**Mission Leader (Catholic Health):**
"Align Laudato Si' goals with financial stewardship—every dollar saved through operational efficiency is a dollar for charity care and community benefit."

**COO:**
"One platform, three standards, zero extra workload—30-day implementation with minimal IT lift and no disruption to clinical workflows."

---

### Differentiation One-Liners (By Competitor)

**vs. Shadow.eco:**
"We don't build generic carbon tools—Lighthouse HLTH is healthcare-native with HIPAA compliance, OR waste tracking, patient-days normalization, and features shadow.eco will never have."

**vs. Consultancies:**
"Replace $50-100K annual consulting spend with a self-service platform that delivers continuous intelligence—not one-time PDFs that gather dust."

**vs. Point Solutions:**
"One unified platform for HB21-1286 + Practice Greenhealth + GHG Protocol compliance—not fragmented tools requiring manual reconciliation."

**vs. DIY/Excel:**
"Your team's 100+ hours of spreadsheet work costs $50K+ in hidden labor with 20%+ error rates—automate compliance and eliminate penalties."

---

### Objection Handling Scripts

**Objection: "We don't have budget for new software"**

**Response:**
"This isn't a software purchase—it's an operational investment that pays for itself. At $35K annual cost and $67K identified savings, you achieve payback in 6 months. Every dollar after that goes to margin or mission."

---

**Objection: "Our EHR vendor is building sustainability features"**

**Response:**
"Great—keep them on your roadmap. Use Lighthouse for HB21-1286 compliance starting this year while you wait. If their module is better in 18 months, you can switch. But November 1st deadlines don't wait."

---

**Objection: "We need to see it work for another Colorado hospital first"**

**Response:**
"Completely reasonable. We offer 40-60% design partner pricing for first Colorado customers. You get exceptional value ($25K vs. $50K standard), shape our US roadmap, and become our reference—or wait 18 months and pay double."

## Conclusion & Next Steps

### Summary

The current Lighthouse HLTH Framer website is **fundamentally misaligned** with our strategic GTM positioning. It presents a patient-facing medical practice instead of a B2B operational sustainability platform for hospital systems.

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Product Mismatch:** Website sells clinical services; actual product is B2B SaaS
2. **Value Prop Absence:** No mention of 15-20% margin improvement, $67K savings, or 18-month ROI
3. **Stakeholder Messaging:** 0% coverage of CFO, Facilities, Mission Leader, COO personas
4. **Regulatory Hook:** Zero Colorado HB21-1286 content despite it being our primary go-to-market angle
5. **Differentiation:** No positioning vs. shadow.eco, consultants, or DIY approaches

**Overall Alignment Score: 2.5/5**
- Value Proposition: 1/5
- Stakeholder Coverage: 0.5/5
- Brand Voice: 2/5
- Content Pillars: 0.25/5
- CTAs: 0/5

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

**Owner: Marketing/Content Lead**

1. **Approve Quick Wins (Phase 1)** - Text swaps on About page
2. **Review Services Page Recommendations** - Decide on full rebuild vs. iterative approach
3. **Prioritize Colorado Playbook** - High-impact lead generation asset
4. **Assign Framer Development Resource** - Internal or external agency
5. **Schedule Stakeholder Review** - Founder, Sales, Product alignment on messaging

### Strategic Recommendation

**Recommended Approach: Phased Rebuild (12-Week Timeline)**

**Weeks 1-2:** Quick wins + Services page overhaul
**Weeks 3-4:** Colorado playbook landing page
**Weeks 5-8:** Homepage rebuild
**Weeks 9-12:** ROI calculator + optimization

**Budget:** $35,000-50,000 (external agency) OR 400-500 internal hours

**Expected Impact:**
- Lead capture rate: 0% → 5-10%
- Demo request rate: 0% → 2-3%
- SEO ranking: Unranked → Top 3-5 for target keywords
- Pipeline generation: 15+ qualified opportunities/month (per GTM targets)

### Final Note

This audit reveals a **template website that has not been customized for the actual product**. The good news: strategic messaging exists in the northstar-strategy repo. The challenge: translating that strategy into compelling web content and executing the Framer build.

**The About page subheadline gets it right:**
"Make sustainability make sense for US hospitals: financially, clinically, and operationally."

**Everything else needs to follow that North Star.**
