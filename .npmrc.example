# NPM Registry Configuration for GitHub Packages
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to .npmrc (which is gitignored)
# 2. Replace YOUR_GITHUB_PAT with your actual Personal Access Token
# 3. Your PAT needs the following scopes:
#    - read:packages (to install packages)
#    - write:packages (to publish packages)
#    - delete:packages (optional, to delete package versions)
#
# CREATE A GITHUB PAT:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens (or org settings for org-level PAT)
# 2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
# 3. Give it a descriptive name like "lighthouse-hlth-ui-publishing"
# 4. Select the required scopes mentioned above
# 5. Copy the token and paste it below
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
# Never commit .npmrc to git! It contains your authentication token.
